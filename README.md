Description:
============
This program takes two hexadecimal numbers as input, and determines if the first number is greater, less, or equal.
To run, simply unzip the file into your directory of choice, and run the Program in PCSpim.

As an extra feature, near the end of the code is a commented off section where, with the "#" removed, one can
actually see the integer values of the hexadecimal strings.

For best usage of this product no more than 8 characters per string must be used.
